Ideas:
- We might need a different function definition syntax that's a little more
long-winded so we can allow arbitrary specification of traits.
- What about having "where x has ... {" blocks that will only execute if a
variable has a certain trait.
- Partial application should be built-in.
- We want pretty light-weight lambda functions too.
- Maybe have some way of making early returns more clear?

Function Design:
- Functions are marked with the 'fun' keyword.
- 'fun' was chosen because it has three letters
and lines up nicely with a 4-space tab.
- The keyword is followed by a name, then a tuple
of arguments.
- The function body is delimited by braces.
- Parameter types are inferred from the body of
the function.
- Functions with the @entry decorator will be
called if a module is executed directly instead of
being imported.
- Anonymous functions are defined in the same way,
with the name ommitted.


fun name(a, b): returntype {
    body;
}


@entry
fun main(): void {
}


fun (a, b): something {
}


Questions:
- What about functions that return nothing?
- Or functions that return an unchecked type?
- What happens when two types have variables of
the same name, so that they both pass the
attribute test? Is that something we need to
guard against?
