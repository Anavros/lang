# I think side effects in general should be
# contracted. There's no way to keep a handle on
# every other thing possible.

# So there are a few things we're looking out for:
# global variable access, side-effect-producing
# function calls, and input mutations.

# See `scope` for global variables.

# See `mutation` for side-effect-producing calls.

# See `passby` for input mutation.

# And that should cover all side effects.
# In summary functions that have the potential to
# do something spooky at a distance are marked as
# such; and parameters that might be mutated by a
# function are marked as such as well.

###
There's also the concept of effect annotations.

Functions are defined with input signatures that
must be fulfilled when called. Every function
defines its list of arguments and their types,
which is all checked at compile time, but could
also extend to include runtime checks on given
variables.

Invariants are constraints put on certain
variables. These might already be handled with
type modifiers.

# One big use of contracts is array indexing. If
# we have a better way to bound indices, it may
# obviate a lot of use cases for contracts.
