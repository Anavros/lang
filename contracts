# I think side effects in general should be
# contracted. There's no way to keep a handle on
# every other thing possible.

# So there are a few things we're looking out for:
# global variable access, side-effect-producing
# function calls, and input mutations.

# See `scope` for global variables.

# See `mutation` for side-effect-producing calls.

# See `passby` for input mutation.

# And that should cover all side effects.
# In summary functions that have the potential to
# do something spooky at a distance are marked as
# such; and parameters that might be mutated by a
# function are marked as such as well.
