Delimiters:
- { } Braces denote blocks of statements. Each statement in a block terminates with a semicolon.
- ( ) Parentheses show lists of expressions. Expressions are separated by commas. A comma may optionally follow the last item in a list.
- [ ] Brackets are used for various type constructs.
- < > Angle brackets are reserved for comparison operators.

Or:
- ( ) Parens are for tuples and function applications.
- [ ] Brackets are for lists and are also reused as type specs.

fun example(int x) {
    statement1;
    statement2;
}

struct Point[N] {
    N x, y, z;
}
# Or
struct Point[N] (N x, N y, N z);

items = Vector[Int](1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
tuple = (1, 2, 3);
hashmap = (
    "a" = 1,
)
hashmap = (a=1, b=2, c=3);
# Should maps allow omission of quotes for string keys?
# Probably not.
# But it does conflict with named arguments in functions.
hashmap = [a=1, b=2, c=3];
hashmap = [1='a', 2='b', 3='c'];
