Delimiters:
- { } Braces denote blocks of statements. Each statement in a block terminates with a semicolon.
- ( ) Parentheses show lists of expressions. Expressions are separated by commas. A comma may optionally follow the last item in a list.
- [ ] Brackets are used for various type constructs.
- < > Angle brackets are reserved for comparison operators.

Or:
- ( ) Parens are for tuples and function applications.
- [ ] Brackets are for lists and are also reused as type specs.

fun example(int x) {
    statement1;
    statement2;
}

struct Point[N] {
    N x, y, z;
}
# Or
struct Point[N] (N x, N y, N z);

items = Vector[Int](1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
tuple = (1, 2, 3);
hashmap = (
    "a" = 1,
)
hashmap = (a=1, b=2, c=3);
# Should maps allow omission of quotes for string keys?
# Probably not.
# But it does conflict with named arguments in functions.
hashmap = [a=1, b=2, c=3];
hashmap = [1='a', 2='b', 3='c'];

# There really needs to be a way to visually join
# braced statements together.

if x {
} else {
}
# Vs
if x { }
else { }
# Vs
if x {
}
else {
}

# But how?


###
Concept:
-> Remove braces or at least semicolons.
Motivation:
-> They are a little visually cluttering.
-> The primary motivation for keeping delimiters
is explicitely marking where statements end.
-> Notably, this makes multi-line statements much
easier to handle.
-> If we have a dedicated method for multi-line
statements (and perhaps another for
multi-statement lines), then we might be able to
axe the delimiters.
