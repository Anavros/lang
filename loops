Ideas:
- Add a loop keyword for infinite loops.
- Use iteration-based for loops like python.
- List comprehensions would also be nice but could
  maybe be tweaked a bit? They might generalize
  to a composable inline looping method.
- While loops with actual conditions are not super
  common in my code but they are still important
  enough to exist. Maybe we can combine loop and
  if in one expression.

# Infinite Loop
loop { f() }
loop {
    f()
    break if not g()
}

# Looping on a Condition
loop if i < 10 {
    i += 1
}
loop if not i >= 10 {
    i += 1
}
# Versus
while i < 10 {
}
until i >= 10 {
}
