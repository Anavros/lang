Concept:
-> Some functions are closely tied with
structures, such that it would make sense for them
to be associated.
-> There could be a special type of function that
specifically operates on one kind of struct.
-> Which is essentially normal object orientation.
###

# Should there be a special class of functions
# that only modify a single item? Is that common
# enough?

mod push5(List l) {  # modification function
    l.push(5);
}

m = l.push5();
l.push5()!;

# They are very tied with structs, pretty much in
# the same way normal objects are. And some things
# are just going to be like that I think.

struct Contact {
    String name, password, address;
}

fun change_name(Contact c, String name) => Contact {
    c.name = name;
    return c;
}

mod change_name(String name) for Contact {
    self.name = name;
}

# It doesn't actually make that big of a
# difference. And it would make things more
# complicated under the hood.

# So probably no then.
