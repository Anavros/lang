Concept:
- Brace-delimited blocks and colons do the same thing. Colons are for one line
  and braces are for many.
- Is it better than just using braces?
- And how important are braces really?
- There's also the concept of a prefix statement, where the statement comes
  before the conditional.

if true: f()
if true {
    f()
}
match var: 1 {
    f()
}
match var: 1: f()

Versus...

if true { f() }
match var { 1 { f() } }

Versus...

f() if true
f() match var 1  # that one doesn't really work
