###
A sequence is a set of arbitrary items stored in
some order. Sequences are unsorted and untyped.
They are implemented like lists in python: as
arrays of pointers to arbitrary objects.
###

###
Implementation details: A sequence of arbitrary
objects would have to be an array of object
pointers in c. We would also want different kinds
of sequences like arrays that directly store the
memory.

module sequence {
    Sequence = Type { }

    new = Func(length:Num) : Sequence { }

    insert = Func (s!:Sequence, element:Any) {
    }

    concat = Func { }
    length = Func { }
    contains = Func { }
    index = Func { }
    sort = Func { }
    join = Func { }
}

# Usage

import sequence;

s = sequence.new(5);
s.
