###
A sequence is a set of arbitrary items stored in
some order. Sequences are unsorted and untyped.
They are implemented like lists in python: as
arrays of pointers to arbitrary objects.
###

###
Implementation details: A sequence of arbitrary
objects would have to be an array of object
pointers in c. We would also want different kinds
of sequences like arrays that directly store the
memory.

# Module
Address = import mem.Address;
Array = import array.Array;

Sequence = Type (length:Num) {
    items = Array[Address](length);
    Index = Num[max=length-1];
    put = Func (s:Sequence!, element:Any, i:Index) { }
    get = Func (s:Sequence!, i:Index) { }
}

contains = Func { }
index = Func { }
sort = Func { }
join = Func { }

# Usage

import sequence;

s = sequence.new(5);
