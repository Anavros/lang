###
Concept:
-> Functions usually can only communicate one
return value.
-> However, they have a lot more information to
give.
-> Besides their normal values, they have side
effects, mutations to their inputs, errors,
including panic situations where the function can
not finish, even changes to global variables.
-> So only having one return value is missing out
on a lot of good information.
-> The trouble arises when accessing those values.
-> Some things can be done by contract; say in the
function definition a certain value is marked
mutable.
-> And at least one can be accessed through normal
assignment.
-> But what about the others?
-> Traditionally, in c, a pointer was sent in and
used to set a value.
-> This is clunky and error prone.
-> So how else?

# Function Interaction
val = return();
mutate(val);
if condition();
while condition();
try { mayerr() } except;

# Example: File Reading
# Iterate over every character in a file, stopping
# when the EOF is reached.
loop {
    c = file.read();
    break if c == EOF;
}

for c in file.readchars() {
}

# See `contracts`.
