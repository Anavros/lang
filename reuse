# Really there are two positions happening here.
# On one hand, some structures are going to
# operate similarly internally, allowing reuse of
# functions. On the other hand, some things need
# separate functions that behave the same
# externally.

fun printall(items) {
    # What type is items?

# Approach 1: Duplicate Functions
fun printall(List items) { }
fun printall(Array items) { }
fun printall(Tuple items) { }
# And so on.

# Interfaces
fun printall(<T has iterate> items) { }
# Or
interface Iterable { iterate() }
fun printall(Iterable items) { }

# Inheritance
type Sequence {
    data items;
    func iterate() { }
}
type List inherits Sequence { }
type ...
fun printall(Sequence s) { }

# Trait Composition
trait Sequence {
    dat sequence;
}
trait Iterable {
    fun iterate();
}
type List {
    has Sequence, Iterable;
    Int index;
}

# There's even a solution for conflicts.
trait Conflict {

}
type MyList has Sequence, Iterable, Conflict;
fun printall(Iterable items) {
    for Item i in items.sequence {  # ambiguous?
    }

# What about a reimplement ability?
# Aka overriding. It would have to be explicit.
