 Most Noteworthy Features
==========================

:Types:
# The type system is very lightweight and based completely on composition.

# Objects can be made from more than one type.

# Function parameters can require more than one type for an object.

# Parameterized types like arrays can contain objects with a set of types.

# Incomplete types can be used as interfaces.

:Mutability:
# Parameters are references that are immutable by default.
        def try_to_mutate(Point p) {
            mut p.x = 10;  # not allowed
        };
        try_to_mutate(p);

# Parameters can be set as mutable individually.
        def try_to_mutate(Point p!) {
            mut p.x = 10;
        };
        try_to_mutate(p!);  # success

:Exceptions:
# There are no exceptions, only panics and result types.
        file = open?("example.txt") err stdin;

:Syntax:
# Variables are not case-sensitive and underscores are ignored.

# Source files can be written in one of many syntaxes. Different syntaxes
# compile into the same abstract syntax tree.
