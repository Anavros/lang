Concept:
-> Monads are cool.
-> They can be used to provide external context to
a function call.
-> They can also represent state as a series of
transformations on an initial value.
-> Implementing monads, or something similar,
could help simplify our state machines and make
things like undos, synchronizing, and algebraic
reasoning possible.
