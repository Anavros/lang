Notes:
- Calling syntax should be clear.
- Ruby for example allows calling functions with
no variables without parens.
- I think that's too easy to get functions mixed
up with variables.
- We already have a split between functions and
structures.
- Maybe structure member variables can have a
different calling syntax?

struct Point(x, y, z);

# Special type of function?
# Modifies an instance of one particular struct.
fun zero(Point p) => Point {
    p.x = p.y = p.z = 0;
}

p = Point(1, 2, 3);
zero(p);
p.zero();  # ufcs
p.x  # ambiguous?
p->x  # two chars = bad
p'x  # weird and unnecessary?
