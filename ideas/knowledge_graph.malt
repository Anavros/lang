One of the big goals of the language is to make things obvious. It should be
clear what does what, and when.

It might be helpful to model how a new programmer learns the structure of an
extant project. It would consitute a graph, with an origin at some main module
or entry point, and moving outward. It should be obvious where to look to find
something.
