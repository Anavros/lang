Concept:
-> Some languages, like Ada, use output variables
rather than return values.
-> It's an interesting concept to think about.
-> We could maybe extend it even farther to denote
possible error cases too.

fun divmod(n:d:Int) : (d:m:Int) {
    return d, m;
}

(d, m) = divmod(8, 2);

# So it would work pretty much just like a normal
# tuple return, but with a more explicit
# declaration of return values.
