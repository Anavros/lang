Maybe we'll do all call-by-reference, where references can be mutable or not.

If everything is a reference, we shouldn't need to mark bindings as mutable or
not. It should be handled by the reference. This subverts the problem where you
might have an immutable reference to a mutable container. In this case, if you
have an immutable reference, you aren't allowed to change *anything*, whatever
that that thing is.

Point = [x:y:z:Num];
a = Point(1, 2, 3);
b = Point(7, 8, 9);

const = (p:Point) : Point {
    # p.x += 1;  # not allowed! immutable reference
    return Point(p.x+1, p.y+1, p.z+1);
};
c = const(a);
a == Point(1, 2, 3);
c == Point(2, 3, 4);

mut = (p:Point!) {
    p.x += 1;
    p.y += 1;
    p.z += 1;
};
mut(b!);
b == Point(8, 9, 10);

mixed = (p:Point!, n:Num) {
    n = 6;  # not valid? should it just shadow? maybe we need split bind/assign
    #n <- 6;
    #val n = 6;
    #foo() -> bar() -> baz();
    e += n for e in (p.x, p.y, p.z);
};
mixed(c!, 5);
c == Point(7, 8, 9);


b <- (a -> const() -> const() -> const());
b = a.const().const().const();

How to handle shadowing of immutable references?
###

countdown = (n:Num) {
    countdown(n-1) if n > 0;  # not an assignment; fine
};

increment = (n:Num) {
    while n < 10 {
        n -= 1;  # assignment to an immutable reference; not fine
    };
};

# What if you want to reuse the same name?
increment = (n:Num) {
    n = 0;
    rebind(n, 0);
    n rebind 0;
    while n < 10 {
        n -= 1;  # assignment to an immutable reference; not fine
    };
};

# Using block scoping.
rebind = (n:Num) {
    print(n);
    do {
        n = 5;  # n isn't imported from outside scope
        print(n);
    };
};
