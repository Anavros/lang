This problem domain might be a good fit for message-oriented programming.
Imagine a set of actors, each with their own internal state and functions,
communicating over a series of named channels. It's highly concurrent, avoids
global mutation, and works well with interactive systems. Mixed with a healthy
dose of standard procedural programming, it could be pretty effective.
