###
Parameters are passed by reference, where references can be mutable or
immutable. Sometimes you'd like to reuse an immutable variable, but how?
###

x = 5;
x = "string";  # is that allowed?

f = (n:Num) {
    n += 1;  # not allowed, assignment to immutable
    n = 1;   # kind of unclear?
    shadow n = 1;  # clear but long
    m = n;   # fine on all accounts, but sometimes you want to use n
};
