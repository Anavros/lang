Honestly everything needs to be async and easy to thread. I'm not a huge fan of
threading, usually because it's complicated and unintuitive, but this is a
language for interactive systems. Good threading could save the day here.

We'll need a couple of components working together here. For one, we already
have a good way to keep track of mutation, through read/write references and
mutating functions.
