###
Creating new variable and modifying an existing one are two separate tasks.

x = 1;
do {
    x = 10;
};
print(x);  # ambiguous

x = 1;
do {
    ^x = 10;  # clunky and confusing
};
print(x);

let x = 1;
do {
    x = 10;
};
print(x);  # 1; reasonable but not the most clear

x = 1;
do {
    x := 10;  # not a fan of that operator, but it does have precedence
};
print(x);

let x = 1;
let y = 1;
do {
    mut x = 10;
    let y = 10;
};
print(x);  # 10
print(y);  # 1
