# Panic crashes the program. It is only used in irrecoverable situations;
# everywhere else, use result types. Panics can not be recovered.

# It can be manually induced using the panic function.
panic!();

# Results can be handled gracefully with an 'err default' or unwrapped
# forcefully. If a result is unwrapped and it turns out to be a failure, the
# program will panic.
let f = open?(name) err stdin;  # if failure, f = stdin
let f = force!(open?(name));    # if failure, panic
