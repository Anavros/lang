Function signatures have a lot more than normal going on, with types, contracts,
return values, and such. So we may want to consider a different sort of syntax
for declaring them. Possibly even integrating tests and documentation.

# Our Type[key=val] syntax is an example of dependent typing, and could maybe be
# extended to include runtime checks against other variables.

fun value_at_index[T](a:Array[T], i:Num[max=a.length]) : T;
